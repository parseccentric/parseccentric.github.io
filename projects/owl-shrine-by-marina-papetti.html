        <p>Thanks to Marina Papetti for the concept art, and the permission to model and post this! Please see the <a href="https://marina_papetti.artstation.com/projects/3qRdzA">ArtStation
            page</a> and <a href="https://marina_papetti.artstation.com/">Marina's profile</a>.</p>
        <p>This was made as part of an <a href="https://polycount.com/discussion/comment/2793880">Environment Art Challenge</a> on the polycount forums. I adjusted my model based on feedback
            from Fabi_G.</p>
        <p>I uploaded this to my website and <a href="https://dangbrandondang.itch.io/owl-shrine-by-marina-papetti">itch.io</a> because of the GLSL shaders, which would not be supported on SketchFab. Thanks for checking it out!</p>
