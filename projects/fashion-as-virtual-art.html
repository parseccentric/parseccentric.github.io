            <h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
            <p>I designed, prototyped, and implemented a WebXR AR application for an exhibition, Fashion as {Virtual} Art. To support the app, I created a small website and designed posters to hold the QR code to the website and a Hiro image for marker-based AR tracking.</p>
            <p>The exhibition was designed by Professor Chiara Vincenzi using virtual garments that her students created in Tilt Brush (Open Brush). It also showed a video of the WebXR VR multiplayer critiques made possible with Project Komodo.</p>
            <p>The software is the first example I am aware of that could display Tilt Brush garments with the correct colors, shaders, and animations on built-in mobile browsers via marker-based AR. The tilt-loader code is thanks to the folks at Icosa. I saved a copy of the experimental code because Icosa was hard at work evolving their platform. Unfortunately, partway through the exhibition, I learned the hard way that deep in the code, there was a request being made to their API, and that request was now failing because they (understandably) introduced CORS protections.</p>
            <p>I appreciate the high level of patience and understanding of everyone involved, and I now have something to tangibly remind me to be careful with in-development and early-version third-party libraries.</p>
