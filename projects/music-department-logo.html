        <h1>Music Department Logo Variations</h1>

        <h2>Psychedelic Variation</h2>
        <img class="gallery-wide" src="../media/music dept logo psychedelic.png" alt="3D render of letter M squeezed into a lyre, with green and red lines emanating toward the viewer">
        <p>While I was in marching and concert band, I modeled a 3D version of our music department's logo from an ink drawing. I'm not sure who to attribute the drawing to, but I believe it was the work of Greg Schwaegler.</p>
        <p>I was learning how to use post-processing nodes when I got a killer effect. I tuned it a bit and proudly showed it to my teacher, since it gave me the feeling of sound coming towards the viewer.</p>

        <p>I had fun also experimenting with the type for the marching band name.</p>

        <h2 class="clear-both">Superhero Variation</h2>
        <img class="gallery-wide" src="../media/music dept logo superhero.jpg" alt="3D render of letter M squeezed into a superhero costume inspired by Superman">

        <p>My senior year show featured superheroes, so I challenged myself to synthesize the logo and the Superman logo. This was my best clothsim render.</p>

        <h2>Cover Image Variations</h2>
        <img class="gallery-wide" src="../media/music dept logo realistic black.jpg" alt="3D render of letter M squeezed into a lyre, shining brightly on a black background">
        <img class="gallery-wide" src="../media/music dept logo realistic white.jpg" alt="3D render of letter M squeezed into a lyre, casting a shadow on a white wall">
        <p>The dark version was meant to serve as a cover image for our social media. The lighter version came first, and was born of the joy of tutorials; a yellow light to one side and a blue light to another made this look stunningly realistic to me. On further review, it looked pretty crusty, so I went for a studio-lit look, which you see here.</p>
        <p>Check out the animation on <a href="https://sketchfab.com/dangbrandondang/">Sketchfab</a>, and you can view the same renders as above on my <a href="https://dirtspacer.artstation.com/">ArtStation</a>.</p>
