        <h2>Connecting Players to Content They'll Love at Rec Room, Inc.</h2>
        <h3 class="tag blueBG whiteText">UI Engineering</h3>
        <p>At Rec Room, I helped deliver UI improvements backed by A/B testing and analytics. I helped improve the
            cross-platform game menus, including localizing text, showing more data in the UI for discovery, and
            freshening up content layouts. </p>
        <p>
            * Enabled official support for eight languages by using proprietary and Unity localization tools to prepare
            in-game text for a third-party localization service, strengthening the game's presence in the existing
            markets.</p>
        <p>
            * Improved time spent and room visits by X.X% for new players by reducing vertical and horizontal scroll to
            just vertical scroll in the main content menu, which was part of a UI simplification experiment.</p>
        <p>
            * Improved first-party and UGC playable content discovery by implementing a doubled-height content row;
            increased impressions by X.X% and click-throughs by X.X%.</p>
        <p>
            * Shipped other experiments and improvements: one to improve the experience of inviting friends to a
            session, if the two players are on different versions; one to experiment on notification frequency for
            mobile phones; one to add a zoom button to the avatar hat selection screen.</p>
        <p>
            * Fixed bugs in support of a project by the Lead UI Engineer; their project significantly sped up rendering
            on VR headsets and enabled more flexible layouts.</p>
        <p>
            * Fixed bugs in support of content discovery features in the player's personalizable room and in a new
            player discovery flow; my teammates' features reduced cognitive load and increased impressions and
            click-throughs.</p>
        <p>
            * Shipped several content discovery experiments that validated the control group, which gave my product
            leads useful metrics to design follow-up experiments.</p>
