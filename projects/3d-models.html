        <h1>Hobby 3D Projects</h1>
        <p>Everything on this page was modeled, textured, and rendered in Blender and Cycles, and animations were compiled with VLC.</p>
        <p>Some of the models below can be explored for their topology on my <a href="https://sketchfab.com/dangbrandondang/">Sketchfab</a> page, and you can view the same renders on my <a href="https://artstation.com/dirtspacer/">ArtStation</a>.</p>

        <h2>Music Department Logo Variations</h2>
        <img src="../media/music dept logo psychedelic.png" alt="3D render of letter M squeezed into a lyre, with green and red lines emanating toward the viewer" class="gallery-wide">
        <p>This has a <a href="music-department-logo.html">dedicated page</a>.</p>

        <h2>Hatsune Miku Character Model</h2>
        <img class="gallery-wide" src="../media/miku model 01 oversaturated.png" alt="Hatsune Miku stands in front of a black wall, in a T pose.">
        <img class="gallery-right" src="../media/miku model 00 triumph.png" caption="First version of the model." alt="Hatsune Miku stands in front of black wall, with hands on hips.">
        <br class="clear-both">
        <p>The Miku that's standing in a power pose was my first ever attempt at a character model. The second attempt (seen above with spotlights) featured much cleaner geometry and better topology, after I made the painful decision to start over. I'm glad I did.</p>

        <h2>Reversapalooza</h2>
        <img class="gallery-wide" src="../media/reversapalooza.png" alt="3D render of the word reversapalooza, with traffic cones and road signs circling behind it">
        <br class="clear-both">
        <p>In high school driver's ed, we had a dedicated labyrinth of concrete we called "The Range", and one unit was to perform all driving functions in reverse. I took the teachers' quirky name for this day and made a poster.</p>

        <h2>Fifth-Generation iPod Touch</h2>
        <img class="gallery-wide" src="../media/fifth gen ipod touch.png" alt="A render of five 2011 iPod touches, with a slightly different rotation about the vertical axis for each.">
        <br class="clear-both">
        <p>I love Apple products, and I thought the iPod touch was so beautiful that I had to model and animate it. I can't find the finished render, but you can see the animation on <a href="https://sketchfab.com/dangbrandondang/">Sketchfab</a>. The screenshot was taken directly from Apple's website.</p>

        <h2>Futuristic Sink</h2>
        <img class="gallery-wide" src="../media/futuristic sink close up.png" alt="A sink with a multi-joined faucet, stainless steel angled handles near the front of the counter.">
        <img class="gallery-wide" src="../media/futuristic sink compact mode.jpg" alt="The same sink with the flaps folded in, and the faucet collapsed.">
        <img class="gallery-wide" src="../media/futuristic sink with room.png" alt="A zoomed-out shot, where you can see a contemporary style kitchen.">
        <br class="clear-both">
        <p>I loved to invent when I was younger, so I came up with this fashionable sink with lots of doodads. I believe this was one of my first animations. I was blown away by using HDRis to light my scene.</p>

        <h2>Futuristic Void Concept</h2>
        <img class="gallery-wide" src="../media/futuristic void chair with shader.png" alt="top viewport: four levitating granite stools. bottom viewport: a node-based shader setup.">
        <img class="gallery-wide" src="../media/futuristic void lit from top.png" alt="tori of increasing size levitate above a small outdoor room.">
        <br class="clear-both">
        <p>This concept was made to explore the lack of gravity possible in 3D spaces, with the intimacy of a small group setting. I also toyed around with shaders to make the granite stools.</p>
