        <p>(Guest on upcoming podcast episode as of 3/25/22)</p>
        <p>With Elisandro Cabada</p>
        <h1 id="my-contributions">My Contributions</h1>
        <p>The four best descriptions of my work are software project management, software testing, virtual reality
            development, and web development. My role never cleanly fit into any of these categories, and I’d switch
            hats as the team needed. I’m comfortable continuing to do so, but I enjoy hands-on making — writing
            features, fixing bugs, refactoring code, designing interfaces, making 3D models — the most.</p>
        <p>For software project management, I co-designed features that would become part of our core product or forks
            of the core product, with two instructors and one PhD student. I would share the results of our
            brainstorming, user story mapping, status updates, and discussion with the team, and also lead Scrum
            ceremonies to order and update the work, all using online tools like Miro and GitHub. I co-presented the
            project at conferences and as part of a podcast, contributed to our own grant applications, created training
            and instructions for using the platform in a classroom, and continued to explain the project from technical
            and non-technical perspectives to any potential partners. As a result, two instructors were able to use our
            product across three semesters, with an average session time of 90 minutes, with up to eight students per
            session, and we were able to contribute some support to ongoing PhD research.</p>
        <p>For software testing, I helped our project status evolve from experimental prototype to classroom product by
            introducing and regularly updating WebXR VR manual test plans, web automated testing, internal VR test
            sessions, and a public VR test session, with everything done remotely. We worked with the Oculus Quest 1
            &amp; 2 and the Rift S. I created templates for issues and pull requests modeled off of typical DevOps
            processes, and helped adapt the Git branching strategy to fit a shifting team makeup. I subscribed to the
            idea of refactoring as we’d implement new features or fix existing ones. As a result of my work, we
            specified many tests, caught many edge cases, refactored many lines of code, and had no unrecoverable
            classroom sessions.</p>
        <p>For virtual reality and 3D development, I modeled, textured, and lit two new virtual environments, two
            existing virtual environments, 3D UI elements, and 3D models for the classroom activities. I remixed an
            existing model to make our avatar. (It’s not fully inclusive by nature, but I’m proud of its simple
            likeability in place of any future, customizable avatar system.) My strongest feature contributions included
            a 3D/VR menu redesign, a VR height calibration feature, and an interface for our SocketIO-based relay
            client. I pair-programmed larger features including Tilt Brush Toolkit integration, support for multiple
            third-party 3D model runtime import tools, and 6DOF-controller based scaling gestures (both for objects and
            the world). Sometimes I’d contribute to prototyping features. I drove the project in a direction of more
            visual and interactive consistency, higher-fidelity 6DOF-controller interactions, and higher polish.</p>
        <p>For web development, my strongest contributions included fixing bugs on our SocketIO relay server,
            refactoring the server into modules, creating an admin monitoring page for the relay server, and using
            ThreeJS to create a utility that could turn uploaded images into rectangular prisms in the GLB (v2) format.
            I became adept enough to independently maintain our Linux server. I wrote and presented a guide for
            deploying our platform on any Linux server (or AWS EC2). Through frequent interface and architecture
            sketches, I helped team members design and implement features. Our platform grew more robust in our admin
            panel features and our experimental immersive capture system under my guidance.</p>
        <p>I had some experience with team supervision, but while I deeply appreciated my team members (and what we were
            able to accomplish), I am not seeking management opportunities at this time. If you’re curious, I researched
            accessibility, privacy, and security training resources; provided training for course assistance, virtual
            reality development, and web development; and helped coordinate studio resources, schedules, all-hands
            meetings, and one-on-one meetings. Our team makeup shifted with each semester, so I periodically revised our
            processes to fit the people. </p>
        <h1 id="collaborators">Collaborators</h1>
        <p>I highlighted my best accomplishments above, by I owe a lot of gratitude for people who taught or inspired me
            on this project.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the many fantastic team members and fellow staff I got to work with:</p>
        <p>Yifan Bao • Xianzhuo (Patrick) Cao • Yi-Shiuan Ho • Jiayu (Jonathan) Lin • Mihir Joshi • Welisa Lewis • Nishi
            Mehta • Dennis Piehl • Xiaohan Yin • Wendy Zhu</p>
        <p>I appreciate the vision, attention to detail, and risk-taking innovation I saw firsthand from our instructor
            and researcher partners: PhD candidate James Planey, Dr. Andre Schleife, and Professor Chiara Vincenzi.</p>
        <p>Thanks to David Tamayo for innovating in the project and sharing tons of knowledge, to William Mischo for
            unwavering support in the face of many challenges, to Elisandro Cabada for being the number one champion of
            the project, and to Robert Wallace for architecting the platform and practically mentoring me on software
            development.</p>
